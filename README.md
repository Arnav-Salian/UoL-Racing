## UoL Racing React Web App

I developed a React.js version of the UoL Racing website to enhance my React and JavaScript skills. The previous WordPress site was too slow, so I created this new site to improve performance and user experience. Due to university restrictions on university-owned domains, I continued the project independently after leaving the team.
